# Project: Robotic Arm - Pick & Place
## Robotics Software Engineer - Udacity Nanodegree
Almost everyday, our lives are touched by various robots in subtle ways. The cars we drive are for the most part assembled and painted by robots. Most snacks we eat are processed by and packaged by robots. Infact when something is ordered on amazon,our orders are handled by more robots than humans. Having actual moving shelves with target product to the packaging station, ,robots take care of most tasks in a warehouse. Yet one of the reasons why a company like Amazon still needs people is to pick things up off those shelves and put them into shipping boxes and to restore shelves as necessary. It turns out these tasks that humans find relatively simple actually require complex solutions when it comes to robots. In order to successfully pick and place an object in a semi-unstructures environment,the robot needs to identify the target object on the shelf, plan and perform a clean movement towards the object, and finally, efficiently grasp the target object without disturbing other objects. To motivate the advancement of thesee challenges, Amazon organizes the Amazon Robotics Challenge every year. This project solves a part of the puzzle by using manipulator kinematics to perform a pick and place exercise just like the Amazon Robotics Challenge.
